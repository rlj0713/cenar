Cenar Application:

Goal: To provide the user with a simple recipe and a corresponding shopping list without pages of ads, pop-ups, and blog articles.

Application Flow:
1 - The user will select a preference for dinner protein.
2 - The app will print a list of meal options with that protein.
3 - The user then selects an option.
    3B - The user indicates the number of people eating (if I finish early).
4 - The user selects shopping list / recipe.
5 - The app prints the shopping list or recipe with modifiations.


Objects (Classes) Needed:

    CLI Object (start / initiate)

    API Object
    
    Recipe Object
        - Protein attribute
        - Shopping List attribute
        - Procedure attribute

    Could Ingredients be objects and Recipes could be objects that have ingredients? (<-- maybe if I finish early)
        Ingredients could have unit of measure attributes!
        Could a shopping list also be an object that contains multiple recipe objects with ingredient objects?
        Recipe objects could contain ingredient objects and...this is going to create turtles (I mean objects) all the way down.
