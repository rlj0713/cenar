Cenar Application:

Goal: To provide the user with a simple recipe and a corresponding shopping list without pages of ads, pop-ups, and blog articles.

Application Flow:
1 - The user will select a preference for dinner protein.
2 - The app will return a list of meal options with that protein.
3 - The user then selects an option.
3B - The user indicates the number of people eating.
4 - The user selects shopping list / recipe (modified for serving size).
5 - The app returns the shopping list or recipe with modifiations.


Objects Needed:

    Recipe
        - Protein attribute
        - Shopping List attribute
        - Procedure attribute

    Could Ingredients be objects and Recipes have ingredients? (<-- maybe if I finish early)
    Could a shopping list be an object that contains multiple recipe objects?  (Also yes, but that's step #2)
